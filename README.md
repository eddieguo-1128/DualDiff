# Dual-Objective Diffusion Models for EEG

It's implemented as part of [CMU 11-785 Course on Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S25/index.html).

## Baseline

- **Motor Imagery** Adapted from [EEGNet](https://github.com/amrzhd/EEGNet/tree/main) for BCI Competition IV 2a dataset.

- **SSVEP** A baseline model adapted from [Hybrid-EEGNET-CharRNN](https://github.com/kkipngenokoech/Hybrid-EEGNET-CharRNN-predictor). Dataset: [Tsinghua BCI Benchmark Dataset](https://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html).

- **P300** Adapted from the [P300 Speller](https://github.com/Manucar/p300-speller) repository.

- **FEIS** Baseline implementation for imagined speech decoding. *Source to be updated.*

This project is based on the [DiffE repository](https://github.com/yorgoon/DiffE), which implements a denoising diffusion model for EEG data generation. We adapted and extended core components.
