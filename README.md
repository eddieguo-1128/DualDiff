# Dual-Objective Diffusion Models for EEG

It's implemented as part of [CMU 11-785 Course on Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S25/index.html).

This project is based on the [DiffE repository](https://github.com/yorgoon/DiffE), which implements a denoising diffusion model for EEG data generation. We adapted and extended core components.
